		Hi! I'm Michele Mennonna, I'm a Rome based rigging artist and TD, class 1994. I attended a three years course at IED(European Design's Institute)
		focused on CG Animation. I'm really passionate about arts and technology, I find my greatest satisfaction in working on any project that mix arts and programming
		for achieving its best results.
		<br>
		I obtained my bachelor in  july  2016. We can assume I'm actually a fresh man!
		<br>
		My main software ,as you can assume from my reel, is Autodesk's Maya, but I also occasionally mess around with SideFX's Houdini and Maxon's Cinema4D.
		<br>
		My main skills comprehend rigging in Maya and Cinema4D,Mel and Python scripting and Houdini dynamics.
		<br>
		I'm always starving for learning new techniques and for debating about 3D stuff, so do not esitate contacting me for any doubt, question, etc.
		<br>
