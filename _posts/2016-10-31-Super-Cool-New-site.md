Hello everybody! If you are reading this that means you stepped in to my super-cool awesome new site.
The purpose of this site is actually sreading my words and discussing about 3D stuff but, just for today, 
as first sensed post of my super-cool awesome new site,I'd like to talk about my super-cool awesome new site.
A long time past since last time i dealt with web stuff. A week ago I decided I needed a super-cool awesome new site 
and bought my domain (did I really need it? probably no.). I didn' esitate diving in a world of awesome tools that reminded 
my of ancient memories. I discoved some cool stuff I didn't know back then such as Github Pages and Jekyll. This tools helped me
easily creating a fast and static blog. I also made use of <a>Zurb's Foundation</a> for achieving a mobile-first responsive site.
